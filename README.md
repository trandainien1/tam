# ScoreAGC - Evaluate the importance of CAM for every heads 

This is github implementation of ScoreAGC

## Description

This github is used for Insertion/Deletion evaluation of ScoreAGC

Our ScoreAGC is implemented in del_ins.py

## Github references

- Special thanks to the following githubs to support our evaluations and references. 

[Attention Guided CAM: Visual Explanations of Vision Transformer Guided by Self-Attention](https://github.com/LeemSaebom/Attention-Guided-CAM-Visual-Explanations-of-Vision-Transformer-Guided-by-Self-Attention)

- Detail our usage in these githubs:

We clone these githubs and implement our methods inside them. Besides, we also use their implementation of evaluation to help us in conducting evaluation metrics.
